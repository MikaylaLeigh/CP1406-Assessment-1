            <th class="planright">The website is designed towards a younger age group, specifically those between the ages of 15-30 years old. For a website to appeal to the younger end of the spectrum, the site must be engaging with fun vibes. To appeal to an older audience, the website needs to be easy to navigate so that users can get the information they need quickly. By catering to both sides of the scale, they will keep balance while creating a design that appeals to both. Graphic elements will be simple however will make the design unique. The colours will be vibrant however informative; with a limited palette there will be specific colours for certain aspects which will subconsciously colour-code for the users.</th>
